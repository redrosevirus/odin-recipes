        <h3 class="header">Let's Cook!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse and boil the chicken breast until fully cooked. Shred the chicken breast afterwards.</li>
            <li>While waiting on the chicken to boil. Dice the onion to very fine bits and chop the celery down to small pieces.</li>
            <li>Heat up the skillet and melt the stick of butter if you chose to use it.</li>
            <li>Once the heat is ready, it's time to start cooking Chop Suey! Put all the vegetables in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Once the vegetables have been cooking for a minute or two, it's time to add the rest!</li>
            <li>Throw in the shredded chicken; the cream of mushroom soup; soy and teriyaki sauce to flavor. Then quickly mix everything!</li>
            <li>Cook until the veggies are completely done. Depending on choice usage of Soy and Teriyaki sauce, darkening of the chicken is a good 
                indicator when you're ready.</li>
        </ol>
