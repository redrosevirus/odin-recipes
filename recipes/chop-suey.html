        <h1>Chop Suey!</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Onion (yellow or white, your choice)</li>
            <li>4 Tablespoons of Butter (Absolutely optional)</li>
            <li>3 Chicken Breast</li>
            <li>1 Bundle of Celery</li>
            <li>1 4oz Can of sliced Water Chestnuts</li>
            <li>1 8oz Can of Bean Sprouts</li>
            <li>1 8oz Can of Cream of Mushroom Soup</li>
            <li>1 Bottle of Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Bottle of Teriyaki Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Let's Cook!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and boil the chicken breast until fully cooked. Shred the chicken breast afterwards.</li>
            <li>While waiting on the chicken to boil. Dice the onion to very fine bits and chop the celery down to small pieces.</li>
            <li>Heat up the skillet and melt the stick of butter if you chose to use it.</li>
            <li>Once the heat is ready, it's time to start cooking Chop Suey! Put all the vegetables in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Once the vegetables have been cooking for a minute or two, it's time to add the rest!</li>
            <li>Throw in the shredded chicken; the cream of mushroom soup; soy and teriyaki sauce to flavor. Then quickly mix everything!</li>
            <li>Cook until the veggies are completely done. Depending on choice usage of Soy and Teriyaki sauce, darkening of the chicken is a good 
                indicator when you're ready.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Congratulations on your Chop Suey! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Fun tip: You can use an electric mixer to quickly shred the chicken! Warning though, 
            use the electric mixer in quick bursts, have had incidents of the chicken turning to paste.
