        <h1>Stir Fry</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Whatever vegetables you want, I use frozen mixed bags for convenience.</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce and whatever other flavors you wish to use.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Cooking oil. I like seasme oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cook it!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in skillet/wok</li>
            <li>Once oil is smoking, throw in veggies and start stirring!</li>
            <li>When veggies reach partially cooked, add sauces to desired amount</li>
            <li>Keep stirring! Nobody said stop!</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is almost entirely gone, turn off heat and set aside to cool.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>YES!</h5>
        <p>There you have it, stupid simple stir fry. Honestly the hardest part is timing when to add the sauces and how much. That and constantly stirring
            the food so you don't burn dinner.
